AbstractUser vs AbstractBaseUser
The default User model in Django uses a username to uniquely identify a user during authentication. If you'd rather use an email address, you'll need to create a custom User model by either subclassing AbstractUser or AbstractBaseUser.

Options:

AbstractUser: Use this option if you are happy with the existing fields on the User model and just want to remove the username field.
AbstractBaseUser: Use this option if you want to start from scratch by creating your own, completely new User model.
